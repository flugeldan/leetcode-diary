# 412. Fizz Buzz
# Difficulty: Easy
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/

I have done it in two ways, one is one-line(slower), and second one is 0ms of runtime
fizzbuzz = []
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 15 == 0:
        fizzbuzz.append('FizzBuzz')
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        fizzbuzz.append('Fizz')
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        fizzbuzz.append('Buzz')
    else:
        fizzbuzz.append(str(i))
return fizzbuzz

Well it just checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5
Then checks if its not divisible by previous, could it be divided by 3, then 5, if none of previous, it just adds str(i) into list

def fizzBuzz(n):
    return ["FizzBuzz" if i % 15 == 0 else
            "Fizz" if i % 3 == 0 else
            "Buzz" if i % 5 == 0 else
            str(i)
            for i in range(1, n + 1)]
15 is just 3 5

if cond1:
    A
else:
    if cond2:
        B
    else:
        if cond3:
            C
        else:
            D
