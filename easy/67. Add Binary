Kind of an easy problem, just gotta int both integers, put them in our calculating system, add to each other, then make it to binary, and str it.

class Solution(object):
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        return str(format(int(a,2)+int(b,2), 'b'))
        

str- makes it string
format(integer, 'b') - returns it to binary
int(a,2) int(b,2) puts them into our system and adds to each other
