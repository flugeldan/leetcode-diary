# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/

Easy one, honestly could be solved way easily, gonna sleep and come back to it to optimize it

class Solution(object):
    def addDigits(self, num):
        while num>9:
            newnum=0
            for i in str(num):
                newnum+=int(i)
            num=newnum
        return num

  While num <9 (more than 1 digit)
Adding "newnum" and setting it to zero after everycycle
Making num str in cycle so i can operate with it digits like with indexes
After that adding every digit to newnum, and after cycle making num into newnum, and after that newnum being set to zero so it can be again sum of digits
