# 43. Multiply Strings
# Difficulty: Medium
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills

class Solution(object):
    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        return str(int(num1)*int(num2))

Easy problem tho, just gotta make int both strings, multiply, and make the product string
Str- makes product string
int(num1) int(num2) turns both elements into integers
