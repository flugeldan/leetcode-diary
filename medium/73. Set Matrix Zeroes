# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
# Difficulty: Medium

Well, first medium problem, i have spent about 1,5h. After i sent code to chat for a quick review, as it said, i can use flags and sets.
I will come back to this after i will take a rest, so i could rethink the code, and understand the logic of the optimized version.

class Solution(object):
    def setZeroes(self, matrix):
        extra=[]
        for row in range(len(matrix)):
            for col in range(len(matrix[row])):
                column=matrix[row]
                if column[col]==0:
                    extra.append((row, col))
        for row, col in extra:
            for i in range(len(matrix)):
                matrix[i][col]=0
            for j in range(len(matrix[row])):
                matrix[row][j]=0
        return matrix

1.Using a first cycle to remember every row and column, adding them into list extra with coordinates.
2.Creating second cycle with 2 cycles inside.
First cycle sets all columns to 0 by using coordinates.
Second cycle sets entire row to zero, using its length (len(matrix[row))
Problems in this code: 
Sometimes you might set zero where you already once did, so on big data its bad for time

To optimize, you can use flags in the matrix itself (in the first row and the first column).
